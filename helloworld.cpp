#include<iostream>

//why write iostream include header file library, as we can make use of input certain things, feeded to the program
using namespace std;
//std is like defining a scope
int main(){
    //main is a function which is returning a int here
    cout<<"hello world!"; //print hello world
    return 0; //means successful program into the OS without bug/error
}

comments (multiline)
works this way too
